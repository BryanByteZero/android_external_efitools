How to use these files

simply typing make will build you everything including sample certificates for
PK, KEK and db.

The prerequisites are the standard development environment, gnu-efi version
3.0q or later, help2man and sbsigntools.

There will be one file called LockDown.efi.  If run on your efi platform in
Setup Mode, this binary will *replace* all the values in the PK, KEK and db
variables with the ones you just generated and place the platform back into
User Mode (booting securely).  If you don't want to replace all the variables,
take a dump of your current variables, see sig-list-to-cert(1), and add them
to the EFI signature list files before creating LockDown.efi

Say you want to concatenate an existing platform-db.esl file, do this:

make DB.esl
cat platform.esl DB.esl > newDB.esl
mv newDB.esl DB.esl

and then make LockDown.efi in the usual way.

All of the EFI programs are also generated in signed form (signed by both db
and KEK).
